## Dependencies

- **ðŸ“œ Git Library** - The project uses [git2go](https://github.com/libgit2/git2go) library for performing all the git
  operations
- **ðŸ“ˆ GraphQL** - [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) is used for generating boiler-plate GraphQL code which
  is the backbone of the whole project
- **ðŸ“¡ HTTP Router** - [mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) is used as the HTTP router for graphql playground and sets
  a handler for the API entry point

### Libgit2 usage

The project uses **git2go** - A libgit2 based binding for go to handle all the git operations. So libgit2 must be setup
properly to run the project.

Follow [these](https://libgit2.org/docs/guides/build-and-link/) instructions to build libgit2
from [source](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2). Follow this only if you have openssl and libssh setup in your
machine. If this is not the case then follow the detailed instructions mentioned in [LIBGIT_NOTES](LIBGIT_NOTES.md) for
a step-by-step guide

## Gitconvex as a Git API

Gitconvex can function as a service without the UI. The whole API is build with graphql, and the underlying
queries/mutations can be accessed by invoking `http://localhost:9001/gitconvexapi`.

GraphQL playground is enabled to experiment with the GQL queries and mutations. It can be accessed
from `http://localhost:9001/gitconvexapi/graph`
